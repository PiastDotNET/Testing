### Application Testing

***

### Agenda
 * Why do we test?
 * Unit tests
 * Integration tests
 * UI tests
 * Q&A

***

### Why do we test?
 * Even if it compiles, it does not mean everything will work
 * Check logic, communication, even configuration

---

### Test frameworks in .Net
 * Nunit
 * XUnit
 * Moq
 * NSubstitute
 * Pact.Net
 * Selenium

***

### Unit tests
 * Automatic testing of our logic
 * Tests single functions
 * Should not depend on other classes

---

### Mocks
 * Testing classes with dependencies
 * Forces to use good practices

---

# Demo

***

### Integration tests
 * Testing functions with their dependencies
 * Testing more than single function
 * Using real implementations instead of mocks

---

### Pact.Net
 * Testing communication between services
 * Helps in testing microservice architecture

---

# Demo

***

### UI Tests
 * Automatic testing our front end
 * Tests user functionality
